Task Board

## Description

This Challenge is a blog, where you can add your post with title and content, and it will show your post on the other page with the username you added on the form, both pages there is a way of changing the website to dark mode. I had a lot of trouble trying to make the post stay on the page when you click on the back button, I was not able to do it so just removed from the website.


This Challenge is a Task Board , where you can add a task that you need to do and when you add it goes automacally  to the TO DO board, and when you complete you can drag the task to in progess or Done, if you can you can also delete the task added. I had a hard time to make the card dragabble so i ended up giving up since my time was short. 

## Usage

To use the website there is a button called Add Task, when you click a form shows on your scren to you add a task, when you click the button add task from the form your task will go to the TO DO board, so you can move to the other boards when you start doing or when you complete. It also has a button called Delete if you want to delete your task.
